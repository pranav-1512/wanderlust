<h6>Lad Bazaar:</h6>This Charminar market during the Qutb Shah dynasty, it is believed, had around 14,000 shops. Even today Lad Bazaar, or its more popular moniker, Charminar market is the address in Hyderabad for stunning glass and lac bangles, outside of jewellery, silks, spices, perfume oil, incense and other knickknacks. Plenty of Irani chai stalls too for you to take a breather from all the walking around.
<br>
<br>
<h6>Makkah Masjid:</h6>Get atop the first floor of Charminar for a panoramic view of the city and while you do, look out over another important landmark from the Qutb Shah reign, the Makkah Masjid. Commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the central arch of this grand mosque has bricks made from the soil of Mecca, the holiest shrine in Islam.
